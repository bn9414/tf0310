For other events, 50% of final package price should be paid in advance to confirm the order, then the rest 50% can be paid when we deliver the photo books.

    <div class="quest1" id="homelink"><p>What is Candid Wedding Photography?</p> <div class="down"></div> </div> 
    
      <div class="ans1box"><div id="ans1"><p>The simple philosophy of candid photography is keeping things as real as possible because you are real. Do you know when you will be more beautiful? Simple, when being as you, a complete you. Candid photography provides freedom of expression by unlocking you from giving poses in front of a camera. There is no preparation time, there is no time to make you look better in front of lenses, so we freeze your moments as it happens so it is completely natural. This is the way the candid photography is done. We believe that candid photography is the key to cherish your memory for ever.  </p> </div></div>
   
    <div class="quest1"><p>Do you guys add videography in your package?</p> <div class="down"></div> </div> 
    
      <div class="ans1box"><div id="ans1"><p>Of course, we do. In every package we have videography. To know more please contact us.

          <div class="quest1"><p>Difference between traditional and candid photography? </p> <div class="down"></div> </div> 
    
      <div class="ans1box"><div id="ans1"><p>In traditional photography, you prepare yourself for the better pose. You decide which needs to be clicked and which are not. Everything’s are captured very formally and in sequence. In candid photography, the photographer prepares to capture your unprepared moments. The photographer decides which moments to be clicked and it is highly artistic.
