               <h1>Complimentary Basic website</h1>
            <p>     We love helping entrepreneurs. We have planned to offer the complimentary website to the few aspiring entrepreneurs from India. We went through the profiles of several startups/freelancers to filter the good ones. Now we have selected a small group of good entrepreneurs and decided to offer a  website to every one of them to grow their startup without charging even a penny. You have been selected as one to get our complimentary website. Below are the few things that we are about to offer you.</p>
                
                <ol>
       <li>         We buy  domain for you(.com/.in extension).</li>
<li>We offer free hosting in Hostgator.</li>
<li>We offer free business email id(Eg: Yourname@companyname.com or contact@companyname.com)</li>
<li>We build an informative website for your business using front-end language of  HTML, CSS, Javscript and angular js. We are not going to provide you any website template, we are about to design everything from the scratch for your business. So the website can be built in whatever the way that you want it to be.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>NOTE: This is the basic website. If you want to have rich graphics, high professionalism, pleasing user experience, kindly get the quotation for our premium webiste service. To referral partners we give quotation only to cover the human resource cost, not for our profits</p>
               </div>
              
                
            <div class="webbox">
               <h1>Flat 20% commission on every successful referral you make</h1>
            <p>	The commission of 20% is something big to us but, still the reason to offer such a commission is to build a good relationship. We are more concerned about the people (relationship) than the profits. Once your referral pays us the advance amount to confirm the order, we will transfer your commission immediately to your bank account, that’s it. All you want to do is just to refer your potential clients to us. </p>
               </div>
              
                
            <div class="webbox">
               <h1>We support you and your business from all angle.</h1>
            <p>Since we are a startup we know the hurdles present in it. so we involve much in helping other entrepreneurs for the success of their startup. In our team there are various domain people like legal, marketing, business analysis and so on. So you will be just a few yards away from getting any help from us.</p>
               </div>
             
            <div id="procedure" >
              <h1 class="ben_h pro_h" style="text-align: center"><span>Procedure</span><img src="images/refer.svg"> <br/>to become referral partner</h1>
            <p> If we offer this partnership for free, everyone will take. So it becomes hard for us to track who is really interested in this partnership and who is not. So we charge you the small amount of <span><img src="images/inrc.svg"></span> 399 to join in this partnership program. We will refund this <span><img src="images/inrc.svg"></span>399 along with your first referral commission. Let say your first client sign up for <span><img src="images/inrc.svg"></span>20,000. Here your commission is <span><img src="images/inrc.svg"></span>4,000. Now we will credit 4,399 to your account. Our motive of charging <span><img src="images/inrc.svg"></span>399 is not for our pocket, it is only to filter the interested people.<br/>
Kindly give some of your information by filling a form and make a payment to join as referral partner if you are interested.
